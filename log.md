# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Setup Sudoku Solver project, read in puzzle file, check for validity and completeness, generate candidates for empty squares

**Thoughts:** In actuality, this is the result of two days work, but I am officially starting today. Shaking off some holiday cobwebs. Doing some cool
things with sets, generators, and formulas with the sudoku array.

### Day 1: December 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Used "naked singles" to solve easy puzzles. Incorporated timer class to measure performance.

**Thoughts:** Using a naive solution was able to solve many "hard" sudokus just using the "naked singles" method. Research of backtracking but no implementation yet,
I'm considering how efficient I want to make the backtracking, possibly leveraging the number of candidates for squares.
