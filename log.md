# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Setup Sudoku Solver project, read in puzzle file, check for validity and completeness, generate candidates for empty squares

**Thoughts:** In actuality, this is the result of two days work, but I am officially starting today. Shaking off some holiday cobwebs. Doing some cool
things with sets, generators, and formulas with the sudoku array.
